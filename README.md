# 🔄 Rotary Indexing Table

A 3D-printed, Arduino-controlled rotary indexing table designed for precision positioning and automation in manufacturing environments. This project uses a stepper motor, belt-drive mechanism, and custom CAD parts to build a functional four-station rotary table.

## 📘 Project Summary

This project was developed as part of the CAD and 3D Printing initiative under SPAN – Skill Planning and Acquisition Cell. It features a stepper motor-driven indexing table that rotates in 90° steps, controlled by an Arduino. The design integrates a belt-driven mechanism, wooden base, and 3D-printed components to provide a low-cost and stable automation solution.

## 📐 CAD and 3D Printing

Custom parts were designed using CAD software SolidWorks. The components were 3D printed and assembled on a wooden base. CAD images and STL files are included in the project folder for reference.

## 💻 Arduino Code

The Arduino code uses the Stepper library to control the 28BYJ-48 motor. The system is programmed to perform four 90-degree steps, with a 2-second delay between each step and a longer pause after completing a full cycle.

## 📷 Output

The final system successfully rotates through four positions, simulating a rotary indexing table for automated manufacturing tasks. Images of the CAD model and final working setup are included in the repository.
